    <h1>Our different engine technologies</h1>
    <p>Engine technologies refer to the various advancements and innovations in the design, operation, and efficiency of internal combustion engines, electric motors, and hybrid systems. <br> Here are some engine technologies:.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="facility-col">
        <img src="eduford_img/petrol.jpg">
        <h3>Gasoline engine</h3>
        <p>A plain petrol engine, also known as a gasoline engine, is an internal combustion engine that operates on the Otto cycle, using petrol (gasoline) as fuel. It ignites a mixture of air and fuel within the combustion chamber using a spark plug, creating a controlled explosion that drives the pistons and produces mechanical energy. These engines are widely used in various vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, and small machinery, due to their relatively simple design, smooth operation, and good power-to-weight ratio.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="facility-col">
        <img src="eduford_img/twinturbo.jpg">
        <h3>Twin turbo</h3>
        <p>A twin-turbo engine is equipped with two turbochargers, which work to increase the engine's power output by forcing more air into the combustion chamber. This setup usually consists of one smaller turbocharger for low RPMs and another larger one for high RPMs. This design minimizes turbo lag, delivering quicker acceleration and more consistent power delivery across a broader RPM range. Twin-turbo engines are known for their efficiency and high performance, making them popular in sports cars and high-performance vehicles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="facility-col">
        <img src="eduford_img/supercharged.jpg">
        <h3>Supercharged</h3>
        <p>A supercharged engine features a supercharger, a device that compresses air before it enters the engine's combustion chamber. This process increases the density of the air, allowing for more oxygen to mix with fuel, resulting in a significant boost in power and torque. Superchargers are typically driven by a belt connected to the engine, providing immediate throttle response and enhancing low-end performance.</p>
